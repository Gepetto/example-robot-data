This is a 2DOF robot based on qbmove actuators.

qbmove is a muscle-like building block actuator, small and lightweight, and based on the Variable Stiffness Actuation (VSA) principle, designed for constructing innovative robot structures and soft manipulators. It is unique in its ability to endow robots with Natural Motion, i.e. that resembles the elegance and deftness of human motion.
