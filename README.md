You can install this package throught robotpkg. robotpkg is a package manager tailored for robotics softwares. It
greatly simplifies the release of new versions along with the management of their dependencies. You just need to add
the robotpkg apt repository to your sources.list and then use `sudo apt install robotpkg-example-robot-data` or `sudo
apt install robotpkg-py27-example-robot-data` (or `py3X` for python 3.X, depending on your system) if you need the
Python loaders.

### Add robotpkg apt repository
If you have never added robotpkg as a softwares repository, please follow first the instructions from 1 to 3. Otherwise, go directly to instruction 4. Those instructions are similar to the installation procedures presented in [http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/debian.html](http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/debian.html).

1. Add robotpkg as source repository to apt:

		sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/robotpkg.list <<EOF
		deb [arch=amd64] http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/wip/packages/debian/pub $(lsb_release -sc) robotpkg
		deb [arch=amd64] http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/packages/debian/pub $(lsb_release -sc) robotpkg
		EOF

2. Register the authentication certificate of robotpkg:

		curl http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/packages/debian/robotpkg.key | sudo apt-key add -

3. You need to run at least once apt update to fetch the package descriptions:

		sudo apt-get update

4. The installation of example-robot-data:

		sudo apt install robotpkg-example-robot-data


## Show the robot

(you will need pinocchio and its Python bindings)

`python -m example_robot_data [anymal,anymal_kinova,hyq,solo,solo12,talos,talos_arm,talos_legs,tiago,tiago_no_hand,icub,ur5,hector,iris]`

This will work from the `python` subdirectory inside this repository, or if this package has been installed on your
system.
